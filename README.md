# The code in this repository performs all necessary operations to run a Sudoku Challenge website that follows
# MVC design framework. It stores usernames and hashed/salted passwords, as well as high scores associated
# with users, into an appropriate .sql file. The sudokus are randomly generated upon the loading of page puzzle.php

# TODO:
# - Clear out boxes depending on difficulty
# - Replace those cleared out boxes with text input
# - Check user input for validity
# - When all user inputs are valid, add a score to the database
# - Display high scores with a join
